 ## Project 1 - Triangle Filling
 In this project, I perform the coloring of an image using 2 different triangle filling algorithms:
 1. Flat Shading
 2. Gouraud Shading
    
 * `demo_f.py`: This script colors the image using the Flat Shading algorithm.             
 * `demo_g.py`: This script colors the image using the Gouraud Shading algorithm.

## Project 2 - Transformations and Projections
This project deals with the transformation and projection of 3D scenes. It includes the application of affine transformations such as rotation and translation to adjust 3D scenes to the geometry of the camera. Additionally, it involves converting 3D points from the World Coordinate System (WCS) to the camera coordinate system. Also, it generates the perspective projections of the 3D points, taking their depth into account, and returns them to the camera's viewport. In summary, the goal of the project is to project 3D scenes onto the 2D viewport of the camera.

* `demo.py`: Renders the 3D object using the Gouraud shading algorithm and applies 4 affine transformations to it.
